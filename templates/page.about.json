Soon joined by a third partner, we launched Jurassic Fruits with a simple mission: To bring real flavor back to the table.<br><br>\nFruit that’s grown with care, picked when it’s ready, and bursting with the joy we once knew.<br><br>\nWhat began as a shared childhood dream is now a growing tribe — of farmers, seekers, and flavor lovers — all rediscovering what fruit was always meant to be."
