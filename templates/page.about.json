        "slide1_content": "It all started with two childhood friends, raised on fruit, curiosity, and maybe a little too much Jurassic Park. <br><br>\nYears later, that same sense of wonder turned into frustration. The fruit we found on supermarket shelves in Europe was nothing like what we remembered — flavorless, rushed, disconnected from the earth.",

Soon joined by a third partner, we launched Jurassic Fruits with a simple mission: To bring real flavor back to the table.<br><br>\nFruit that’s grown with care, picked when it’s ready, and bursting with the joy we once knew.<br><br>\nWhat began as a shared childhood dream is now a growing tribe — of farmers, seekers, and flavor lovers — all rediscovering what fruit was always meant to be."
